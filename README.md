## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me practice building a responsive card layout using only HTML and CSS. I learned how to use CSS custom properties for colors and fonts, and how to switch images and layout for mobile and desktop using media queries. I also practiced using Flexbox for layout and making sure the design is accessible and visually appealing.

```html
<button class="card__btn">
  <img
    src="./images/icon-cart.svg"
    alt=""
    aria-hidden="true"
    style="width: 16px; height: 16px;"
  />
  Add to Cart
</button>
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on accessibility and maybe add some simple interactivity with JavaScript, such as showing a message when the "Add to Cart" button is clicked.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) - Great for understanding Flexbox layout.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - For real-world practice challenges.
